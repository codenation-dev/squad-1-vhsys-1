To use the filter you have to set your ErrorLogFormat to the default only this way the service can check your logs. Then execute in
CMD the service.php file then it'll ask to you what is your environment, then what is your token then what is the path to the error.log
file. After this the service is going to check the last line of your error.log and everytime that the file changes it'll check 
again and upload the error/warning to our api on the Amazon Server. Any doubts, ask us! :D
